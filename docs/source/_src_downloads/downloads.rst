TudatPy scripts
--------------------------

Below, the TudatPy scripts can be downloaded. The ZIP file contains three directories, ``transfer_trajectory``,
``orbiter`` and ``src``. The relative paths of the files within these directories should remain as they are, as they are linked
like this. The files are divided as follows:

* ``transfer_trajectory`` files
    Contains the input script and executable code scripts for designing MGA-DSM transfer trajectories

* ``orbiter`` files
    Contains the input script and executable code scrips for designing orbiters

* ``src`` files
    Contains files with constants, classes and functions that are used within the executable scripts for both the MGA-DSM
    transfer trajectories and the orbiter
